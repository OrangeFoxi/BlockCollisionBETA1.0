# BlockCollisionBETA1.0
A emulator for blockcollision using the law of "conservation of energy"


At "Blue Speed" you habe to be careful:
from right to left left is plus and from left to right is minus
means: if you insert a positive value into "Blue Speed" the Cube will go to the right
if you insert a negative value the cube will go to the left
(Little tricky but you got thisðŸ˜‰)


Now:
Just open the programm
